 We focus, in this work, on buildings damage assessment (BDA).\
We propose to rely solely on RGB satellite images and follow a 2-stage deep learning-based approach, where first, buildings’ footprints are extracted using a semantic segmentation model, followed by classification of the cropped images into damaged or non-damaged building.\
We conduct extensive experiments to select the best hyper-parameters, model architecture, and training paradigm, and we propose a new transfer learning-based approach that outperforms classical methods.\
Finally, we validate the proposed approach showing excellent accuracy and F1-score metrics
